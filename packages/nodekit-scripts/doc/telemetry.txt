    off ...................... Turns telemetry collection off  

Details
    A timed prompt asking the user to opt-in or out is displayed the first time nodekit is run.
    It lasts for 30 seconds, after which the user is automatically opted-out if he doesn't provide any answer.
    In CI environments, the `CI` environment variable can be set, which will prevent the prompt from showing up.
    Telemetry collection can also be turned off on a single command by using the `--no-telemetry` flag.

Examples
    nodekit-cli telemetry on
    nodekit-cli telemetry off
    nodekit-cli build --no-telemetry
